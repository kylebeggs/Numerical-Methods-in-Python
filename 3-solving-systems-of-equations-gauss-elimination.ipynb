    "Since Gauss Elimination is a direct method (no iterating) the only source of error is round-off error. Of course, we always have round-off error if we are computing, but in iterative methods this round-off gets washed away with every iteration (correction to the solution). Since this does not happen with Gauss Elimination the round-off error accumulates all the way to the final solution. This is both the reason why for small systems Gauss is incredibly accurate (low number of FLOPs), but as the system increases in size round-off becomes significant and at a certain point it produces extremely large errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gauss Elimination has algortihmic complexity of $O(n^3)$ so runtime of the code grows to be prohibitively long quickly. This reason, along with round-off error accumulation is why standard procedure is to use direct methods such as Gauss for small systems, but turn to iterative methods for large systems (n > 10k equations)."
