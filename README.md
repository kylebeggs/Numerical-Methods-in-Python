# Numerical Methods in Python (Undergraduate level)

This repo is a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental numerical methods meant for a
beginner. It is assumed the reader has previous knowledge in Calculus, Differential Equations, basic Linear Algebra, and some experience with Python and the NumPy library. There is an abundance of *free* Python tutorials available on the internet, whether it be on blogs/sites like mine or YouTube. If you have previous knowledge of Python but not NumPy, [I think this is a good, succinct tutorial](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/python-numpy-for-your-grandma-1-1-introduction/).
